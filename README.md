## Development

* When developing a new feature, create a new branch off of master and do your work on that
branch (`git checkout -b rcchen/new-feature`). When you are done, commit your changes to
your branch and push it to Github (`git push origin rcchen/new-feature`). Go to Github and
open a pull request to merge your changes into master, then ping someone other than yourself
to take a look at the code, and have them merge it in.
