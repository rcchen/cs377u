# ping-server

## Development setup

Prerequisites: Homebrew, Python3 (pip, virtualenv)

1. Load the virtualenv by typing in `source bin/activate`
2. Install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If you install 
any dependencies, be sure to add them to the requirements.txt file.
3. Start the virtual server by calling `python3 manage.py runserver`. To verify
that it is running, go to localhost:8000 in your browser.
4. When you are done, exit the env with the command `deactivate`.
